"The Great Transition"

In late 2024, as artificial intelligence begins reshaping the global economy, five people in the same city find themselves on different sides of a technological gold rush that's making some people wealthy while leaving others behind.

Lisa, a marketing executive who discovers she's been unknowingly competing with AI systems for months, turns her revelation into opportunity – teaching other professionals how to survive in an AI-augmented workplace. But as her consulting business grows, she questions whether she's helping people adapt or just profiting from their desperation.

Meanwhile, Marcus, a veteran software architect, watches his "human-only" coding principles transform from a point of pride to a career liability. His search for others who share his convictions leads him to an underground network of tech companies promising "100% human work" – and to difficult questions about whether such promises are sustainable or merely postponing the inevitable.

Wei, a pragmatic hardware store owner, finds unexpected success by transforming his business into a hub for AI-dispatched repair workers. As he becomes increasingly enmeshed in the AI economy, he realizes his role is evolving from traditional business owner to something entirely new: a human interface for AI systems that need physical world interaction.

Their paths intersect with Sarah, hired by a major tech company to document human problem-solving methods before they become obsolete. As she builds her library of human expertise, she discovers other "data archaeologists" doing similar work across different industries, forcing her to confront whether she's preserving human knowledge or helping to make it irrelevant.

James, an early UBC investor profiting handsomely from the transition, tries to help friends and family position themselves for the new economy. But as he watches the human cost of this transformation unfold, he struggles to reconcile his financial success with its impact on his community.

As their stories interweave, each character comes to realize they're not just adapting to a new technology – they're participating in a fundamental restructuring of human society. Their individual choices, from Marcus's resistance to Lisa's adaptation to James's investment, ripple outward to influence not just their own survival, but the shape of humanity's economic future.

The story culminates as these different approaches to survival collide, forcing each character to question whether they're building a bridge to the future or burning the ones behind them. In the end, "The Great Transition" is not just about the end of traditional work – it's about the hard choices people make when their world stops making sense.
