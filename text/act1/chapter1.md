# Chapter 1: The Price of Being Right

James Chen's phone buzzed for the fifth time that morning with another UBC price alert. He silenced it without looking, keeping his eyes fixed on Marcus's untouched coffee growing cold across the table. The same coffee he'd been ordering for his best friend every Thursday morning for fifteen years.

"You're not even going to check it?" Marcus asked, his own cup still wrapped in both hands like a shield. "Must be nice when numbers that big become boring."

"It's not about the numbers." James leaned forward, his casual posture betraying the $3,000 jacket he'd tried to downplay with faded jeans. "Look, I know you think I'm just another crypto bro who got lucky, but this is different. UBC isn't just another token—it's the foundation for everything that's coming. I can help you position—"

"Position myself?" Marcus's laugh carried no humor. "Like you helped Steve 'position himself' right out of his consulting business? Or Jenny's whole accounting department?"

The words hit James like a physical blow. He'd been right about Universal Basic Compute's impact—devastatingly right. Every investment he'd made in the new AI infrastructure had paid off exactly as he'd predicted. He just hadn't expected being right to hurt so much.

His phone buzzed again. This time, it wasn't a price alert but a message from his sister: 'They're installing the new teaching documentation system next week. Can we talk?'

James looked up at his friend of twenty years, then down at the message that meant his sister was next. The coffee between them had gone completely cold.
