# Chapter 1: The Price of Being Right

James Chen's phone buzzed for the fifth time that morning with another UBC price alert. He silenced it without looking, keeping his eyes fixed on Marcus's untouched coffee growing cold across the table. The same coffee he'd been ordering for his best friend every Thursday morning for fifteen years.

"You're not even going to check it?" Marcus asked, his own cup still wrapped in both hands like a shield. "Must be nice when numbers that big become boring."

"It's not about the numbers." James leaned forward, his casual posture betraying the $3,000 jacket he'd tried to downplay with faded jeans. "Look, I know you think I'm just another crypto bro who got lucky, but this is different. Universal Basic Compute isn't just another tech investment—it's the foundation for all AI infrastructure. Every machine learning model, every automated system runs on UBC's network. I can help you position—"

"Position myself?" Marcus's laugh carried no humor. "Like you helped Steve 'position himself' right out of his consulting business? Or Jenny's whole accounting department?"

The words hit James like a physical blow. He'd been right about Universal Basic Compute's impact—devastatingly right. Every investment he'd made in the new AI infrastructure had paid off exactly as he'd predicted. He just hadn't expected being right to hurt so much.

His device lit up with another notification. This time, it wasn't a price alert but a message from his sister: 'They're installing the new teaching documentation system next week. Can we talk?'

James looked up at his friend of twenty years, then down at the message that meant his sister was next. The coffee between them had gone completely cold.

James pulled out his wallet, though Marcus waved him off before he could reach for a bill. Fifteen years of Thursday coffees, and this was the first time Marcus had refused to let him pay.

"I can still afford my own coffee," Marcus said, finally releasing his death grip on the cup. "For now, anyway."

The bitterness in his friend's voice made James's chest tighten. He'd spent the last three years trying to warn everyone about the coming changes, trying to help them prepare. But preparation looked a lot like betrayal when you were the one profiting from other people's losses.

His phone buzzed again. This time he glanced down – another 8% jump in UBC's value. The same technology that was making him wealthy was also making his sister's teaching career precarious and would soon render Marcus's coding philosophy obsolete. The math was elegant, ruthless, and undeniable: human labor was becoming a rounding error in the universal computation equation.

"Look," James leaned forward, lowering his voice though the coffee shop was nearly empty. "What if we set up a transition fund? I've been working on a model that could—"

"Jesus, James." Marcus pushed his chair back. "Not everything needs to be an investment opportunity. Sometimes people just need time to figure things out without someone trying to profit from their struggle."

"That's not what I—"

"Save it for your clients." Marcus stood, shouldering his bag. "Some of us still believe in building things with our own hands, even if we're the last ones doing it."

James watched his friend walk away, leaving the untouched coffee behind. He pulled out his phone again, this time opening his sister's message. His thumb hovered over the reply button as another price alert came in.

The future was arriving exactly as he'd predicted. He just hadn't expected it to cost him quite so much.

The walk to his sister Amy's school took longer than usual. James found himself stopping at every intersection, checking his phone, then putting it away without responding to her message. The UBC alerts kept coming, each one making the knot in his stomach tighter.

Quincy High looked exactly as it had when they'd both been students here, except for the new security scanner at the entrance. The guard recognized him—probably from the donor wall—and waved him through without checking ID.

He found Amy in her classroom, surrounded by stacks of papers and three monitors displaying student data. Her normally neat ponytail was coming undone, loose strands falling across her face as she hunched over her keyboard.

"You could have texted back," she said without looking up.

"Thought this needed to be in person." James leaned against a desk, taking in the organized chaos of her workspace. "How bad is it?"

Amy finally turned to face him, dark circles under her eyes matching his own. "They're calling it a 'Teaching Documentation Initiative.' Like they're doing us a favor." She gestured at the monitors. "Every lesson, every interaction, every technique we use—all getting fed into their system. They say it's to 'preserve best practices.'"

James knew that phrase. He'd seen it in UBC's quarterly reports, right before entire departments disappeared. "Amy, I can help. There are programs, transition funds—"

"Don't." She held up a hand. "I watched you try this with Marcus. I don't need an investment strategy, James. I need my brother to understand that not everything broken can be fixed with money."

The same words, different voice. James felt the weight of his phone in his pocket, another alert vibrating against his hip. Success had never felt so much like failure.

Amy turned back to her monitors, fingers hovering over the keyboard. "You know what Jenny Torres asked me yesterday? If I could record myself reading her favorite book one last time before I leave. She's in seventh grade, James. She shouldn't have to worry about her teacher being replaced by a recording."

James moved closer, glancing at the screens. Student engagement metrics, lesson effectiveness scores, behavioral pattern analysis—it was all there, being quantified and optimized. Just like every other industry he'd watched transform.

"You're not being replaced," he said, the lie bitter on his tongue. "This is about enhancement, not replacement. The AI will handle the routine stuff, letting you focus on—"

"On what?" Amy spun her chair around. "On being a human interface for an AI teaching system? On watching everything I've learned in fifteen years get turned into training data? Tell me, brother, what exactly should I focus on?"

The familiar pressure built in his chest—the same feeling he'd had watching Marcus walk away. James reached for his phone instinctively, then stopped himself. Numbers couldn't solve this problem.

"Remember when Dad lost his accounting job?" he said quietly. "How he kept saying he just needed time to figure things out?"

Amy's expression softened slightly. "He never did go back to accounting."

"No. He found something different. Something better." James pulled up a chair, sitting at eye level with his sister. "The hardware store job with Wei's father. It wasn't what he planned, but—"

"But he adapted. Is that your point? That I should just accept this and find my own hardware store?" Amy's voice cracked slightly. "I love teaching, James. Not managing teaching systems or optimizing learning algorithms. Actually teaching."

Another alert buzzed in his pocket. James ignored it, watching his sister turn back to the screens, her reflection fractured across three displays. Behind her, student artwork covered the walls—hand-drawn pictures gradually giving way to AI-generated images as the years progressed.

"What if," he started carefully, "what if we looked at this differently? Not as an ending, but as a—"

"Please don't say opportunity." Amy's shoulders slumped. "I get enough corporate doublespeak from the administration. I just wanted my brother today, not the investor."

The words hung between them, heavy with truth. James stood slowly, his expensive jacket suddenly feeling like a costume he'd outgrown.

"You're right," he said. "I'm sorry. What do you need from your brother?"

Amy was quiet for a long moment, staring at the screens that would soon know her job better than she did. "I need you to just listen. No solutions. No investments. No optimistic spin about the future. Can you do that?"

James pulled his phone out, turned it off completely for the first time in years, and set it face-down on the desk.

"I'm listening."

Amy's hands twisted in her lap, a nervous habit she'd had since childhood. "Yesterday, I had to document my method for handling student anxiety. Not just the protocol—they wanted every detail. How I adjust my voice, my exact phrases, even my body language. Fifteen years of learning how to help scared kids, all reduced to data points."

James stayed silent, fighting the urge to reach for his phone, to check the markets, to do anything but sit with this uncomfortable truth.

"You know what the worst part is?" Amy continued, gesturing at one of the monitors. "The system's already better at spotting struggling students than I am. It catches micro-expressions I miss, patterns I can't see. Last week it flagged Michael Chen—no relation—" she added with a wan smile, "for intervention before I even noticed something was wrong. And it was right."

"That's not necessarily—"

"I said no solutions," Amy cut him off, but her voice was gentle. "Just listen."

James nodded, folding his hands in his lap to mirror hers.

"I used to think teaching was about knowledge transfer. Facts, figures, formulas. But it's not. It's about being human together." She paused, running her fingers along the edge of her desk. "It's about showing kids that growth is messy and beautiful and sometimes painful."

She looked up at the student artwork on the walls. "See that terrible dragon drawing? Tommy spent weeks on it. The AI could have generated something perfect in seconds, but that's not the point. The point was watching him try and fail and try again."

Through the classroom window, James could see students crossing the courtyard, heads down, phones out. The same technology that was making him rich was reshaping their world in ways even he couldn't fully predict.

"I keep thinking about Dad," Amy said softly. "About how lost he was after the accounting firm let him go. Remember how he used to say computers could never replace the human element of bookkeeping?"

James remembered. He also remembered using those same failed predictions to inform his first UBC investments.

"The hardware store saved him," Amy continued. "Not because it was better than accounting, but because Wei's father saw him as a person, not a skill set to be optimized." She turned back to her brother. "But there aren't enough hardware stores in the world for all of us, are there?"

The question hung in the air between them, heavier than any market analysis James had ever written. For the first time since his investments had started paying off, he found himself without a ready answer.

A bell rang in the distance, and Amy straightened in her chair, muscle memory taking over. "I have a class coming in ten minutes."

James watched as she began organizing the papers on her desk, her movements precise and practiced. Every gesture part of a routine that would soon be optimized out of existence. He thought about Marcus at the coffee shop, about his father at the hardware store, about all the patterns he'd learned to recognize in market data but had somehow missed in the people closest to him.

"You know," he said carefully, "Wei's son is taking over the store next month."

Amy paused in her organizing. "Kevin? I thought he was doing some tech startup."

"He is. That's why he's taking over." James leaned forward, speaking softly as if sharing a secret. "He's turning it into something new. Not just hardware—more like a hub for repair workers, craftspeople. Using AI to coordinate but keeping the human touch Wei's father always talked about."

"James, I said no solutions—"

"No, this isn't—" He stopped, took a breath. "I'm not trying to fix anything. I'm just... listening to what you said. About being human together. Maybe that's what we should be investing in."

Amy studied him for a long moment, the afternoon sun casting shadows through the classroom blinds. The familiar scent of chalk dust and whiteboard markers hung in the air as she reached for his phone on the desk. Her hand was warm as she handed it to him, fingers lingering when he took it. "Promise me something?"

"Anything."

"Next time UBC's price jumps, before you check your portfolio, call me first. Just to talk. About anything except money."

James wrapped his fingers around the phone, feeling its weight differently now. "I promise."

As he stood to leave, Amy called after him. "Hey, big shot investor?"

He turned at the door. "Yeah?"

"Thanks for listening." She smiled, a real one this time. "Even if you couldn't help trying to fix things at the end."

James smiled back, thinking of all the alerts waiting on his phone. "Baby steps, sis. Baby steps."

Walking back through the courtyard, James pulled out his phone but didn't turn it on. Instead, he watched the students passing by, wondering which of them would adapt, which would resist, and which might find entirely new ways of being human in the world he was helping to create.

He had another meeting in an hour with potential investors, eager to hear his predictions about the next wave of AI automation. For the first time, he wasn't sure what he would tell them.
